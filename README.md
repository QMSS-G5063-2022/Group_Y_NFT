### **What will we be doing?** ###
To better understand the NFT space, our team has collected sales, tweets, and network data for NFTs on Ethereum, the most popular blockchain platform to host NFTs.  Throughout the project, we will be looking into:

- An overview of how revenue and user base are distributed across **projects**
- Success of specific NFT projects in terms of **sales** and **user growth**
- A detailed **network analysis** on Ethereum NFTs
- **Sentiment** and **language** used in the NFT twitter space
  - Term-frequency & Sentiment Analysis
  - Topic modeling (LDA)
